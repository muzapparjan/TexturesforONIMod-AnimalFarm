Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, chunky simplified shapes, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building: a storehouse shed (house-like) for feed, tools, and supplies.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to match a 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall footprint (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Ranch Storehouse Shed (gable roof + big doors)
- Overall silhouette: simple gable roof and a boxy shed body.
- Roof: two large panels with a ridge cap; add one small roof vent.
- Front: large double storage doors with visible hinges and a chunky latch mechanism.
- Left: a small side hatch with an inset “crate” panel (pure geometry, no text).
- Right: a small wall-mounted gauge and one green indicator light.
- Bottom: a sturdy base with a small ramp lip and bolt plates.
- Optional: show one simplified feed sack silhouette behind a small viewing slot (very minimal, no labels).

Materials & colors
- Muted industrial gray body with warm yellow/orange accents.
- Subtle worn edges and light grime near hinges.

Quality constraints
- Crisp sprite-like edges, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
