Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, gentle ambient occlusion in seams, minimal but purposeful mechanical details, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building for egg incubation / warming.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to read as 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Egg Incubator Station (sterile sci‑fi)
- Center: a tall main chamber with a rounded door and a small circular window.
- Inside the window: stylized eggs in a tray (simple oval shapes, minimal detail).
- Top: a heater / warm lamp housing (simple glowing bar) and a warning indicator light.
- Left: a small intake drawer with a handle.
- Right: a control box with a timer dial, two buttons, and one bright cyan status light.
- Bottom: a drip tray and a drain port.

Materials & colors
- Clean off-white and light gray panels, teal accents.
- Small yellow warning stripe and a few bolts.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
