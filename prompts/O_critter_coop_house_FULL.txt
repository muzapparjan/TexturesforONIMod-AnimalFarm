Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, cute utilitarian ranch machinery, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch building for small critters that reads like a coop/pen structure, NOT a human house.
- Avoid residential cues: no curtains, no household windows, no interior furniture.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to read as 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Critter Coop House (coop-like, breathable)
- Overall silhouette: gable roof + front mesh/vent panels like a coop.
- Center: large arched entry opening with a rubber flap curtain (3–4 hanging strips).
- Above entry: a wide mesh ventilation panel (hex/rounded grid pattern, simplified).
- Left: a small nesting cubby module (3 small rounded cubbies stacked) with soft shadows.
- Right: a compact feeder/waterer attachment module (small tank + short spout) and one cyan status light.
- Top: tiny roof ridge vent.
- Clear ranch marker: a cute animal face emblem as a raised medallion on the front panel (icon only; no text).
- Include a dedicated empty “nameplate” inset frame (blank, no text) on one side panel.

Materials & colors
- Warm beige/cream main body with muted green accents.
- Mesh/vents in darker gray-green.
- Small orange safety accent and subtle edge wear.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
