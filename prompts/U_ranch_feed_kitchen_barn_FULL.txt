Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi with a ranch workshop feel, clean readable silhouette, chunky simplified shapes, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building: a feed mixing kitchen that looks like a small barn workshop, not a heavy industrial refinery.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to read as 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Feed Kitchen Barn (workshop-barn)
- Overall silhouette: squat barn body with gable roof and a sturdy base.
- Center: a big mixing bin with a rounded lid and a front viewing slot showing simplified pellets/grain.
- Left: a scoop hopper and a small bag holder frame (show one plain bag silhouette, no labels).
- Right: a small hand-crank or wheel (friendly mechanic) and a small gauge.
- Add one cyan status light and one small orange indicator.
- Ranch marker: hanging signboard with an animal face icon relief; plus a second blank placard inset frame (empty) for customization.
- Keep pipes minimal: at most one small pipe port ring near the base.

Materials & colors
- Warm gray/tan panels with muted teal accents.
- Roof muted brown-gray; subtle edge wear.

Quality constraints
- Keep it readable; avoid grimy heavy industry.
- Single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
