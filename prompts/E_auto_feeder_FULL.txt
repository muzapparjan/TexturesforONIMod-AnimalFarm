Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, cute utilitarian machinery, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel segmentation, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, minimal but purposeful details, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building: an automatic feeder.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to match a 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall footprint (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Auto Feeder (practical utility)
- Left: a large storage bin with a curved top lid and a viewing slot showing simplified pellets.
- Middle: a dispensing chute with a chunky wheel/gear and a small funnel.
- Right: a control panel with a lever and a small gauge; add one orange indicator light.
- Bottom: a sturdy base with feet and bolts; add a maintenance hatch.
- Optional: one cable conduit and one small pipe port as attachment points.

Materials & colors
- Muted industrial gray with warm yellow/orange accents; slight edge wear.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
