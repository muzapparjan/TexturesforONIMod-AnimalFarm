Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, cute but industrial, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, gentle ambient occlusion in creases, minimal but purposeful details (bolts, vents, small labels), not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building used to care for small creatures.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to read as 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Grooming Station Pod (warm, friendly)
- Center: a large rounded rectangular chamber with a big viewing window (soft reflections).
- Inside the window: a simplified cute critter silhouette standing on a small platform.
- Add a simple grooming arm silhouette (like a soft brush/comb tool) reaching into the chamber.
- Top corners: two small vents/fans.
- Right side: a small control panel with a lever, knob, and one indicator light.
- Bottom: a thick base frame with bolts and a small drain port.

Materials & colors
- Light beige/cream body with muted green accents.
- Small orange safety accents and a cyan status indicator.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
