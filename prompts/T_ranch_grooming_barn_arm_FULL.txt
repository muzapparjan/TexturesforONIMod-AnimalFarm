Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, friendly ranch mood, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel segmentation, subtle brush texture, soft shading with consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building for grooming, designed as a barn-like station (not an industrial pod, not a human home).

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to match a 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall footprint (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Grooming Barn Station (open stall)
- Overall silhouette: barn stall frame with a small gable roof beam and an open front.
- Center: a stall bay with a simplified critter silhouette standing on a platform.
- Add a grooming arm silhouette (soft brush/comb head) reaching into the stall from the side.
- Left: a tool rack panel with 2–3 simple tool silhouettes (pure shapes).
- Right: a small control box (lever + knob) with one cyan indicator; keep it small.
- Ranch marker: a cute animal-face medallion above the stall and an adjacent empty “badge slot” frame (blank).
- Bottom: thick base with bolts and a small drain port.

Materials & colors
- Warm beige/cream body with muted green accents.
- Small orange safety accent; minimal industrial vents.

Quality constraints
- Readable, not too busy.
- Single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
