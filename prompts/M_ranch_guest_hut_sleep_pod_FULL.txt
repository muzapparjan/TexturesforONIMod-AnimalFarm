Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, cute utilitarian, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch-themed small house hut: a compact sleep/rest pod building that still looks like a tiny farmhouse.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to match a 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall footprint (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Guest Hut Sleep Pod (house silhouette)
- Overall silhouette: tiny house with a rounded gable roof and a front awning.
- Center: a large window revealing a simplified bunk/sleep capsule silhouette inside (very minimal).
- Left: a small door with a round porthole window.
- Right: a compact air/comfort unit (small fan vent + filter canister) attached externally.
- Add one small porch lamp with a soft warm glow.
- Bottom: thick base frame with bolts and a small cable conduit.
- Optional: one small pipe port ring near the comfort unit.

Materials & colors
- Off-white/light gray panels with muted green accents.
- Small cyan status indicator and one tiny orange safety accent.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
