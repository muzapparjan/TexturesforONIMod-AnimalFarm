README (Jiemeng AI prompts for ONI-style ranch building sprite)

What this folder contains
- *.txt: FINAL full prompts. Each .txt file is a complete English prompt you can paste directly into Jiemeng AI.

New additions
- F–M: house/barn/cottage-shaped ranch building silhouettes (still 5x3 footprint), for a more “farmhouse” theme.
- N–U: stronger ranch/animal-shelter silhouettes (avoid human-house cues), includes cute animal icon sign + blank replaceable placard slots.

Target
- Game: Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like) art style.
- Building type: ranch / critter husbandry building (牧场建筑).
- Footprint: 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall.
- Max output: 4096x4096.

How to use
1) Open one .txt file in this folder
2) Copy the entire prompt
3) Generate at 4096x4096
4) Prefer a plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout

Notes
- The prompt already asks the model to compose the building as a 5:3 footprint inside the square canvas (centered, no stretching).
- If results look too realistic, emphasize “hand-painted cartoon”, “not photorealistic”, “2D game sprite”.
