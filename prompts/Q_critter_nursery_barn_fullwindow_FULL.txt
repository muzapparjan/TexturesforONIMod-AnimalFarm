Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi with a gentle ranch vibe, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, minimal but purposeful details, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch building for critter babies/eggs: a nursery barn. It must not look like a human home.
- Avoid residential cues: no curtains, no furniture; keep “animal care equipment” instead.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to read as 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Critter Nursery Barn (big care window)
- Overall silhouette: squat barn body with a small gable roof and thick insulated base.
- Center: a large rounded rectangular viewing window showing a simplified warm bedding tray with tiny egg/critters silhouettes (very minimal).
- Under window: a gentle warming strip/glow bar and a drip tray.
- Left: a small drawer hatch for supplies.
- Right: a compact control panel (timer dial + 2 buttons) with a cyan status light.
- Ranch marker: a cute animal face badge mounted above the window (icon relief).
- Add a blank “swap plate” inset frame near the badge (empty, no text).
- Top: small roof vent.

Materials & colors
- Off-white/light gray panels with warm beige accents and muted teal trim.
- Tiny orange safety accent; subtle grime in seams.

Quality constraints
- Crisp sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
