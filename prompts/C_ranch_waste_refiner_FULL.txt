Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, chunky simplified shapes, rounded corners, clear panel segmentation, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, controlled detail density, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch utility building: manure / ranch waste processing into fertilizer.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to match a 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall footprint (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Ranch Waste Refiner (industrial, a bit grimy)
- Left: a hopper opening with a hinged lid and a chunky latch.
- Middle: a cylindrical mixing drum behind a protective panel with a few inspection slots.
- Right: a small exhaust stack with a simple filter canister and a slow fan vent.
- Bottom: a conveyor-like output chute leading to a small bin.
- Add two pipe ports: one input (water) and one output (liquid fertilizer), with color-coded rings.

Materials & colors
- Darker gray steel panels with slight edge wear.
- Small rust stains near bolts, rubber gaskets, clamps.
- Small warning stripe (yellow/black) on one panel.

Quality constraints
- Keep it readable and not too busy.
- Single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
