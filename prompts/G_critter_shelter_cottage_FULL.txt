Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi with a cute utilitarian feel, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, controlled detail density, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch / critter husbandry building: a critter shelter that reads like a small cottage/house.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to read as 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Critter Shelter Cottage (friendly)
- Overall silhouette: house-like body with a rounded roof ridge (soft gable) and a slightly protruding front porch lip.
- Front: a large arched doorway opening with a soft rubber flap curtain (suggested by 3–4 hanging strips).
- Above the door: a small circular window (simple glass highlight).
- Left: a tiny side window and a small vent grate.
- Right: a small “heater/comfort” unit box with a warm glow bar and one yellow warning indicator.
- Base: thick insulated footing with bolts and a small drain port.
- Add 1–2 small decorative ranch cues as shapes only: a simple hoof-print emblem as a stamped panel relief, or a tiny hanging bell silhouette (no text).

Materials & colors
- Light beige/cream main body with muted green accents.
- Roof in muted brown-gray metal; subtle brush texture.
- Small orange safety accents and a cyan status indicator.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
