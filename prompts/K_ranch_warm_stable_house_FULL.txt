Create a 2D game building sprite texture in the art style of Oxygen Not Included (Klei-like): hand-painted cartoon industrial sci‑fi, warm and friendly, clean readable silhouette, rounded corners, clear panel lines, subtle brush texture, soft shading with a consistent top light, seam ambient occlusion, not photorealistic.

This is a ranch building: a warm stable house (house-like) for keeping critters comfortable.

Camera & composition
- Orthographic front view (flat), no perspective distortion.
- Output at 4096x4096.
- Compose the building to match a 5 tiles wide x 3 tiles tall footprint (about 5:3) inside the square canvas, centered, correct proportions, no stretching.
- Full building visible with small padding around.
- Plain solid background color (pure magenta) for easy cutout.

Design: Warm Stable House (cozy)
- Overall silhouette: a compact house with a gable roof and a thicker insulated body.
- Roof: add a small skylight window (simple highlight) and one roof vent.
- Front center: a large rounded stable door with a smaller half-door panel line (closed).
- Left: a wall-mounted heater module with a warm glow bar and a simple grill.
- Right: a small thermostat-like control panel (dial + 1 button) and a cyan status light.
- Bottom: an insulated base skirt with bolts and a small drain port.
- Add subtle “straw” cue as a tiny tucked bundle shape near the door base (very minimal, stylized).

Materials & colors
- Warm light beige body with muted green/teal accents.
- Roof in muted brown-gray metal; subtle wear highlights.
- Small yellow/black warning stripe on the heater corner.

Quality constraints
- Crisp 2D sprite look, single object only.
- No readable text, no logos, no watermark.
